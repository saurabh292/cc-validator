# cc-validator This program takes a credit card number as input and uses the Luhn algorithm to determine if it's a valid credit card number. It first computes the sum of the digits in the credit card number, taking into account the alternating doubling of every second digit starting from the rightmost digit. If the sum is divisible by 10, the credit card number is considered valid.
